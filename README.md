# Now Playing
The Now Playing app was created to showcase all currently playing movies as well as movies that were previously in theaters.

If you are interested in finding movies currently in theaters near you, you can interact with the app and put your zip code into our theater finder.

This app was created using the following API's:
-tMDB: The API lists the movies.
-GraceNotes Developer API: The API lists all the showtimes based off the entered Zip Code.
-Youtube API: Displays Trailers for the selected movie.
